Configuration files for my current i3 setup

I am saving this for posterity. I do not hate my current color scheme so I needed to save that. Some tiny modifications I have made as well for better user experence.
I have followed tutorials from Alex Booker, YouTube, BookerCodes (I think) on Github and I am grateful for the great work on those videos.
This is going to be uodated incrementally, as I make more and more changes.
